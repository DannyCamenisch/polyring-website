[![Eleventy build](https://github.com/DannyCamenisch/polyring-website/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DannyCamenisch/polyring-website/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

Source code for my personal website, that can be found on the [Polyring](https://polyring.ch), including a blog, summaries and an about section.

⚠️ This repository does not include the summaries, as these pdfs are too large.
